Quick setup c2 infrastructure using docker, empire, and metasploit (WIP)

## TODO:

* Based on [blog entry](https://www.swordshield.com/2016/10/multi-tool-multi-user-http-proxy/) for "Multi-Tool Multi-User HTTP Proxy"
* Use nginx based on https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen and/or https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy
* Create bootstrap script with UUID generator for individual users and ports
* Look at creating empire/metasploit docker containers to run along in proxy network
